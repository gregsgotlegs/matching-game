## Immediate Features

### Convert radios to buttons

Change the radios to buttons, control state of them from outside, maybe buttons in each side have ids from 1 to 5 and each list's state can be represented by one of those ids and null for none selected.

When one side's state matches a button, that button's color is different.

## Future Features

- hook up matches to a google firebase thing (or some other nosql db)
- add timer
- stash stats somewhere
- sign in authentication to an account
- make words fade away once they're answered
- error handling when you incorrectly select a match
- start/reset button

### Checking for duplicate words

If two or more of the same word appear on the same side, allow either of them to be selected for the other one's match.
