## Immediate Features

### Convert radios to buttons
Change the radios to buttons, control state of them from outside, maybe buttons in each side have ids from 1 to 5 and each list's state can be represented by one of those ids and null for none selected.

When one side's state matches a button, that button's color is different.


## Future Features

### Checking for duplicate words
If two or more of the same word appear on the same side, allow either of them to be selected for the other one's match.
